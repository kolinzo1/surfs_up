## Summary

The results of this analysis shows that December, presumably the coldest month at Oahu, is about as warm as June, the warmest month. This implies that Oahu should attract tourist all year round. Some additional queries we could include in this analysis are:
* Precipitation statistics for both June and December at Oahu.
* A determination of the spread of stations where the data was obtained to gauge the reliability of the results.
